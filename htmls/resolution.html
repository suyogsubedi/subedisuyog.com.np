        Year 2020 I tried to learn many things at once. I was learning
        Javascript for one time and suddenly switched to python. I started with
        django and moved to react after making small projects. Because of this I
        had the basics of both world but didn't learn both the things with
        perfection. One time i was even looking at Flutter.
